# New World Crops
Adds some more crops to the game:

Grain:

- Corn


Legumes:

- Kidney Beans

- Green Beans

- Black Beans


Vegetables:

- Potato
- bell pepper



I have not yet balanced the numbers, and the art is kinda ugly. I am not an artist.


Potato plants will not drop seeds. Instead, cut up the potato to get 4 seeds.


Most of the other plants should work pretty similar to their vanilla analogues.





All crops added so far should be able to be cooked into meals as vegetables. Corn will work as both a grain and a vegetable.
